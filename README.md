# DEPLOYMENT-
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following procedure:

* Under the source tab the dropdown "none" was changed to "master branch".
* The page then refreshed.
* The gihub pages section then had a link to the published page.

# CREDITS- <!--Update this-->
* Code for the form was resused from my challenge 2 submission at the end of the running walkthrough. This was then adjusted and added to in order to make it relevant for what the CONTACT page was trying to achieve.
* Credit is also given to my mentor Can Sucullu who provided me with the code to place the map on the contact page and showed me where I was going wrong in the process.
* Thanks also to Bim Williams who introduced me to the benefits of using flex as a CSS element and sent me some extra curricular reading material to understand CSS far better.
